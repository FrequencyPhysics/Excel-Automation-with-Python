It reads data, applies a price correction, creates a bar chart, and saves the results into a new file.

## Features
- Reads an Excel file (.xlsx) automatically.
- Prints the total number of rows in the sheet.
- Applies a 10% discount to prices in column 3.
- Writes corrected prices into column 4.
- Generates a bar chart of the corrected prices.
- Saves results into a new Excel workbook.
